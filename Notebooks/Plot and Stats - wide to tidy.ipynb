To ensure smooth operation, please follow the guidelines below regarding the data format and how to use the notebook.\n","\n","### File Format\n","- **CSV**: Data should be in CSV (Comma-Separated Values) format, easily generated from spreadsheet applications (e.g., Excel, Google Sheets) or statistical software (e.g., R, Python).\n","- **Copy and Paste**: Data can be directly copied and pasted from a spreedsheet software.\n","\n","### Expected Data Format\n","\n","Your dataset should be structured in a wide format, where:\n","\n","- **Columns** represent different conditions and their repeats. The naming convention should follow the pattern `ConditionName_R#`, where `ConditionName` is a unique identifier for the condition, and `R#` indicates the repeat number (e.g., `R1`, `R2` for repeats 1 and 2, respectively).\n","- **Rows** represent individual subjects, samples, or experimental units with measurements under each condition and repeat.\n","\n","### Example Dataset\n","\n","Below is an example of how your data might look when correctly formatted. Note that missing values are allowed:\n","\n","| Condition1_R1 | Condition1_R2 | Condition2_R1 | Condition2_R2 | Condition3_R1 | Condition3_R2 |\n","|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n","| 0.5           | 0.6           | 0.7           | 0.8           | 0.9           | 0.95          |\n","| 0.55          |               | 0.75          |               | 1.0           | 1.05          |\n","|               | 0.65          |               | 0.85          | 1.1           | 1.15          |\n","| 0.56          | 0.66          | 0.76          |               | 1.2           |               |\n","| 0.57          | 0.67          | 0.77          | 0.87          | 1.25          | 1.3           |\n","\n","### How to Use This Notebook\n","\n","1. **Load Your Data**: Use the widget provided at the beginning of the notebook to either enter the path to your CSV file or paste your data directly into the text area provided.\n","   - If entering a file path, ensure the path is correct and accessible by the notebook.\n","   - If pasting data, ensure it is tab-separated as shown in the example above.\n","\n","2. **Specify the Results Folder**: Enter the path where you'd like the transformed tidy dataset and any analysis results to be saved. If the specified folder does not exist, it will be created automatically.\n","\n","3. **Execute the Transformation**: Run the notebook cells in order. The notebook will automatically transform your wide-format data into a tidy format, handle missing values appropriately, and save the tidy dataset as `tidy.csv` in the specified results folder.\n","\n","4. **Review and Analyze**: After transformation, you can proceed with further data analysis within the same notebook or use the tidy dataset in other analytical tools or notebooks.\n","\n","### Notes\n","\n","- The notebook is designed to handle datasets with varying numbers of data points across conditions and repeats by appropriately managing missing values.\n","- Ensure that any specific data processing or cleaning requirements are addressed either before loading the data into this notebook or within the notebook as part of the transformation process.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"cellView":"form","id":"JrkfFr7mgZmA"},"outputs":[],"source":["# @title #MIT License\n","\n","print(\"\"\"\n","**MIT License**\n","\n","Copyright (c) 2023 Guillaume Jacquemet\n","\n","Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\n","of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\n","in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\n","to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\n","copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\n","furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n","\n","The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\n","copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n","\n","THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\n","IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\n","FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
